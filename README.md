# Object-Detection-Models-for-Reducing-False-Positives-in-Pedestrian-Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on developing and evaluating deep learning models for pedestrian detection, with an emphasis on reducing false positives. Leveraging state-of-the-art object detection algorithms such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and ResNet (Residual Networks), this project aims to enhance detection accuracy in complex urban environments, a critical need for real-world applications like Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and surveillance systems.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: Implemented advanced object detection models including YOLO and ResNet for pedestrian detection.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilized transfer learning techniques to improve model performance, especially in challenging environments.
- **False Positive Reduction**: Focused on reducing false positives by fine-tuning models and employing post-processing techniques.
- **Extensive Experimentation**: Conducted experiments on specialized datasets to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the models.

## Architecture

- **YOLO**: A fast object detection model that performs real-time detection with impressive accuracy. It processes images as a whole, making it highly efficient.
- **ResNet**: A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses residual learning to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks. ResNet models were fine-tuned to improve pedestrian detection.

## Dataset

The project uses a custom dataset containing images of pedestrians in various urban environments. The dataset also includes "hard negatives" such as human-like objects that often result in false positives in conventional detection models.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x

## Results

- **Model Performance**: Achieved a significant reduction in false positives while maintaining a high level of accuracy in pedestrian detection.
- **Visualization**: Visualized detection results, including bounding boxes and confidence scores, to better understand model performance.

## Future Work

- **Model Optimization**: Further optimize models for deployment on edge devices.
- **Additional Datasets**: Incorporate larger and more diverse datasets to improve generalization.
